# Question 1 Answers

a. Why did you branch prior to making changes?**
Branching allows me to isolate my changes from the `main` branch, so I can develop without affecting the main project. It also enables safer collaboration through pull requests and easier conflict resolution.

b. What is `git status`? What's the difference before and after commit?**
`git status` shows the current state of the working directory and staging area.
- Before commit: it shows modified and staged files.
- After commit: it says "nothing to commit, working tree clean" if everything is committed.

c. How did you resolve the merge conflict?**
I opened the conflicting file (`story.md`), saw Git's conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`), and manually edited the file to merge the changes. Then I staged and committed the resolved file.

# Question 2 Answers

1. Explain what this command does:
`git log --oneline --decorate --graph --parents` displays a visual representation of the commit history. It includes:
- `--oneline`: Short, single-line format for each commit
- `--decorate`: Shows branch names and tags
- `--graph`: ASCII graph showing branches and merges
- `--parents`: Displays parent commits (useful for merges)

This is useful for understanding how branches diverged and merged over time.

2. Copy and paste the generated graph. Then, explain the graph that is generated from the 
graph. Use what is committed, what is branched and what is merged in your explanation.

Explanation:
- The first commit created the repository and added `story.md`.
- The main branch received several updates to `story.md`.
- I created a new branch and made changes to the same file.
- A conflict occurred when I merged the `main` branch into my branch.
- I resolved the conflict manually and committed the result.
